        // If business_discussed is True, it returns True. Then it sums it.
        // So if business IS discussed, the score goes UP? That sounds wrong for "Discretion Score" unless it means "Business *Securely* Discussed".
        // Wait, `name_avoidance` is `count == 0`. So if name NOT mentioned, it returns True (Good).
        // `payment_invisibility` is `payment_visible`. If visible (True), then `payment_invisibility` is True? 
        // No, usually you want payment to be INvisible.
        // Let's re-read the Python carefuly.

        // But the python code sums the *values*.
        // So if payment_visible is True, it adds 1.
        // Therefore the python code in the prompt might have a typo or I am misinterpreting "payment_invisibility" key as the goal, whereas the code sets it to the bad value.
        // Let's interpret the Intent: "Zero discretion breaches".
        // So we want: name NEVER mentioned, payment NEVER visible.
        // So we want the factors to be checks for GOOD behavior.
        // name_avoidance: true if name_count == 0. Correct.
        // So code should be: payment_visible == false.
        // I will fix the logic to match the "Goal".
